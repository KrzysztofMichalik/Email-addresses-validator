# Email addresses validator

Simple validator created with Symfony console.

## Usage
All you need to do is:
1. Put csv file into /src/resources and
2. Run command line and go into project path
3. Run app with validate command. The command accepts one parameter which is the file name without extension.
4. In root app directory appears three file with script output.


## Notice
You don't need download any dependency, I decided to use only one component instead of the whole framework, so the vendor directory is in the repository
